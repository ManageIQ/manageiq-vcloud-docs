= Adding a VMware vCloudDirector in Red Hat CloudForms

Now that CloudForms, VMware vCloudDirector and RabbitMQ (optional) has been correctly installed, it
is time to add the vCloudDirector as a CloudForms Cloud Provider.

To do so, go to `http://my_cfme_host/` and login with a user who is allowed to
add providers. The default user is `admin` with `smartvm` for his password.
