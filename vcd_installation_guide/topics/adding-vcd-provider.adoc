appear.

Populate the rest of the form with appropriate data to grant CloudForms access to your VMware vCloud Director.

NOTE: VMware vCloud Director cloud provider requires organization-level access. Therefore you need to provide
both user credentials and organization name, hence "Username" field must be of form `username@organization`.

NOTE: Hostname can be either IP address or DNS record. It must not contain any URL path nor protocol prefix
(HTTPS is assumed).

Hit "Validate" when you're done. Validation needs to succeed prior adding the provider. Once green, you can opt-in
to hit "Add" immediately to add provider without eventing support or you can open _Endpoints -> Events_ tab to
fill-in your RabbitMQ credentials. Please see link:./vcd-ampq.adoc[Enable AMPQ Events in vCloudDirector] section to learn
how RabbitMQ needs to be configured to make it work.

Validate the _Events_ tab as well and eventually save the provider by clicking on "Add" button in bottom-right corner
of the form.
