This section describes how to add a new {vcd-provider} to {product-title}
using {product-gui}. First step is to login:

Then navigate to *Compute -> Clouds -> Providers* page using the main navigation on the left.

Opt-in for *VMware vCloud* provider type in a form that appears. Doing so will make other relevant form fields
appear.

Populate the rest of the form with appropriate data to grant {product-title} access to your {vcd-host}.

[NOTE]
======
* {vcd-provider} requires organization-level access. Therefore you need to provide
both user credentials and organization name, hence *Username* field must be of form `username@organization`.

* *Hostname (IPv4 or IPv6 address)* must not contain any URL path nor protocol prefix (HTTPS is assumed).

Hit *Validate* when you're done. Validation needs to succeed prior adding the provider. Once green, you can opt-in
to click *Add* immediately to add provider without eventing support or you can open *Endpoints -> Events* tab to
fill-in your AMQP credentials. Please see <<EventMonitoringRabbitMQVCD>> section to learn
how AMQP needs to be configured to make it work.

Validate the *Events* tab by pressing *Validate* button and eventually save the provider by clicking on *Add*
button in bottom-right corner of the form.
