= Event Monitoring with RabbitMQ

NOTE: this step is optional. It is appropriate in environments where vCloudDirector events will be pushed through RabbitMQ.

== An Overview
The VMware vCloudDirector (vCD) can distribute events and notifications to other AMPQ server allowing the distribution of messages to other clients, in our case RedHat CloudForms or ManageIQ. Please find below the schema of this setting. Please note that the steps in this manual must be repeated for each vCD organization that you want to support Notifications for.

== Prerequisites
We assume that vCD is already deployed with corresponding RabbitMQ installation and that you
have superuser access to both of them. Furthermore, we assume that vCD already sends messages
with notifications to the RabbitMQ – hence exchange named systemExchange already exists inside
RabbitMQ.

We also assume that RabbitMQ has Web GUI installed, although all the configuration below can be
done via RabbitMQ CLI.

== Obtain UUID of the organization

Notification messages that are dropped at RabbitMQ are routed by vCD organization UUID
(ORG_UUID). In this section we provide instruction how to get UUID for a specific organization using
vCD Web Interface.

 * Log in as superuser of vCloudDirector (not in the organisation, in the provider access)
 * Click on "Manage organizations"

* Click on a specific organisation

* Read ORG_UUID from the URL

== Prepare queue for organisation

=== Create
Navigate to Queues tab and add a new queue there, to the same Virtual host as systemExchange.
Name it `queue-<ORG_UUID>` and leave all other parameters on default.

IMPORTANT: Please set parameters exactly as shown in the screenshot above, otherwise ManageIQ
will not be able to consume messages (e.g. if you set auto delete to true instead of false).

=== Subscribe
Navigate to Exchanges tab and open up systemExchange details. In the Bindings subsection add
binding for your queue with following routing key: `##.<ORG_UUID>#`.

Your queue will now receive all messages regarding specified organization. As a last step we need to
add user.

== Prepare user for organisation
=== Create
Navigate to Admin tab and add a new user without any tags. Omitting all tags restricts user to
connect only to the specific queue. Please note that she will not be able to access the RabbitMQ Web
UI as well.

=== Configure
Open up user details and set Configure, Write and Read permission in Permissions subsection. For all
three of them simply use queue name and set the permission.

image::../../images/docs_vcd_rabbitmq08_permissions.jpg[title="Tuning permissions for RabbitMQ user. Configure and Write permissions are required only due to a bug in MiQ library that connects to the queue."]


IMPORTANT: Make sure that you click “Set permission” button after you’ve input queue names or
else user will not be able to consume any messages.

== Summary
Following instructions above the RabbitMQ is configured so that it is safe to provide vCD organization
administrator with RabbitMQ endpoint URL and credentials of the created user. She will only be able
to connect to the queue that is prepared for her and therefore only consume messages related to
her organization.
