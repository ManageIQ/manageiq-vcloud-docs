== AMQP Event Monitoring Configuration for {vcd}

NOTE: Event monitoring is optional, {vcd-provider} can also be added with
event monitoring disabled.

*AMQP Event monitoring* refers to a setup where observed entity emits messages to an AMQP broker from where
another entity can consume them. Event monitoring is an improvement over periodical polling for changes
through observerd entity's API for performance reasons.

{vcd-host} supports AMQP event monitoring but has it disabled by default. There are two configuration
scopes to take care of in order to make event monitoring work for {vcd-provider-full}:

1. Enable AMQP event monitoring option in VMware vCloud Director.
2. Configure RabbitMQ for per-organization consumption.

Following scheme demonstrates expected setup to support event monitoring for VMware vCloud Director cloud
provider.

=== Prerequisites
We assume RabbitMQ message broker is deployed and accessible both from {cfme-appliance} as well as from
{vcd-host}. Administrative access to RabbitMQ and {vcd} is required.

=== Enable AMQP Event Monitoring Option in {vcd}

Following configuration is required on {vcd-host} to enable AMQP event monitoring.

Login into {vcd-gui} as system administrator and navigate to
*System -> Administration -> Management -> System settings -> Extensibility*.

Check *Enable Notifications* checkbox and fill in the required credentials for RabbitMQ in
*AMQP Broker Settings* section. As soon as you save changes, {vcd-host} will start emitting events
to the RabbitMQ broker exchange.

NOTE: When configuring RabbitMQ in the next section we assume *Exchange* name is set to *systemExchange*.
Please use your actual exchange name in case you pick a different one in this form.

=== Configure RabbitMQ for Per-Organization Consumption
Having {vcd-host} successfully configured to be sending messages to the AMQP broker,
administrator then needs to perform some additional configuration on the AMQP broker to restrict access to user's own
organization only. Only then it's safe to dispatch AMQP credentials to organization administrators
who manage {vcd-provider-full}.

RabbitMQ configuration consists of following steps:

* Obtain UUID of the {vcd}'s organization.
* Prepare *queue* for {vcd}'s organization.
* Prepare *user* for {vcd}'s organization.

==== Obtain UUID of the Organization

{vcd}'s messages that are emitted to RabbitMQ are routed based on {vcd}'s organization UUID
(ORG_UUID). Please follow steps below to obtain it.

 * Login into {vcd-gui} as system administrator.
 * Navigate to organization through *Manage organizations* shortcut.

* Read UUID from the URL.

image::../../images/docs_vcd_rabbitmq04_orgID.jpg[alt="ORG_UUID can be seen on the organization details view, since it's part of the URL."]

==== Prepare RabbitMQ Queue for the Organization

{vcd-host} is sending messages (events, notifications) to AMQP exchange named *systemExchange*. Multiple
queues can be subscribed to *systemExchange* exchange, each of them will receive replica of all messages.

Steps below describe how to create a new AMQP queue and subscribe it to *systemExchange* exchange in a way that
only messages for specific organization are delievered to it. {cfme} then consumes messages from the queue to perform event-based actions.

NOTE: Steps below demonstrate AMQP queue configuration via Web GUI, but all the configuration can also be
done via CLI.

.Create Queue with Predefined Name
Follow steps below to create a queue with predefined name so that {cfme} will be able to connect and
consume messages.

Login into RabbitMQ broker Web GUI with administrative user and navigate to *Queues* tab to add a new queue.
Assign it to the same virtual host as where *systemExchange* exchange exists.
Name it `queue-<ORG_UUID>` and leave all other parameters on default.

image::../../images/docs_vcd_rabbitmq05_setQueue.jpg[alt="Adding a queue with predefined name to RabbitMQ. Queue name is important since user permissions are given based on queue names."]

IMPORTANT: Please set parameters exactly as shown in the screenshot above, otherwise {cfme}
won't be able to consume messages. If you accidentally, for example, set auto delete to Yes instead No,
{cfme} won't be able to connect.

.Subscribe Queue to *systemExchange* Exchange
Follow steps below to subscribe newly created queue to *systemExchange* exchange so that queue will start receiving
messages from the exchange.

Navigate to *Exchanges* tab and open up *systemExchange* exchange details. In the *Bindings* subsection add a new
binding for your queue and assign it following routing key (replace `<ORG_UUID>` with organization UUID):

```
#.<ORG_UUID>.#
```

image::../../images/docs_vcd_rabbitmq06_bindQueue.jpg[alt="Binding exchange to the queue."]

Your queue will now receive all messages (events, notifications) regarding specified organization.

==== Prepare RabbitMQ User for the Organization
Having a working queue with predefined name configured, we only need to provide authentication for it yet so that
{cfme} will be able to connect. For this reason we create a new RabbitMQ user and assign it just
enough permissions to access the one queue it needs. Eventually we'll pass this credentials to {cfme}
in order to grant access required for eventing.

.Create RabbitMQ User
Navigate to *Admin* tab and add a new user without any tags. Omitting all tags restricts user from connecting to
any queue.

NOTE: User without any tags won't be able to even access RabbitMQ Web UI.

image::../../images/docs_vcd_rabbitmq07_orgUser.jpg[alt="Adding a new RabbitMQ user without any tags."]

NOTE: Credentials used at this step will need to be entered to the {cfme} because {cfme} will be
connecting to the one queue accessible to this user. Please see <<AddingAVMwareVCD>> section for
exact instructions on where to provide them.

.Allow User to Access One Specific Queue
Open up user details and in *Permissions* subsection set *Configure regexp*, *Write regexp* and *Read regexp*
permissions to point to specific queue. For all three of them simply use queue name and set the permission.

image::../../images/docs_vcd_rabbitmq08_permissions.jpg[alt="Tuning permissions for RabbitMQ user."]

IMPORTANT: Make sure you click *Set permission* button after youâ€™ve input queue name or else configuration won't
be stored and user won't be able to consume messages.

NOTE: *Configure regexp* and *Write regexp* permissions are required due to a bug in underlying {cfme}'s library
that fails to connects to the queue unless full permission is granted.

==== Share Credentials with {vcd-provider} Administrator
Following above instructions you now have the RabbitMQ broker configured in a way that it's safe to provide
respective {vcd} organization administrator with:

* RabbitMQ broker IP/hostname address.
* Credentials of the newly created user.

Using credentials provided, she will only be able to connect to the queue prepared for her organization
and therefore only consume messages related to her organization.
