== Remote Console Access in vCloudDirector through Red Hat CloudForms

*Remote console* is a graphical window that allows you to view desktop of a virtual machine, and to interact
with that virtual machine in a similar way to a physical machine.

VMware vCloud cloud provider supports establishing remote console against running virtual machines. Console window
is opened in browser using https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/html-console[VMware HTML5 WebMKS Console SDK].
Due to VMware licensing restrictions, Red Hat cannot ship the WebMKS SDK in CloudForms

NOTE: vCloudDirector itself needn't be accessible from browser directly since CloudForms serves as proxy
between the two. Remote console feature should work as long as browser can access CloudForms.

=== Prerequisites
Following prerequisites need to be met in order to be able to use remote console access:

* VMware WebMKS SDK installed on CloudForms appliance
* `VMware WebMKS` option selected as default VMware Console Support
* virtual machine that we're establishing remote console against must be powered on

==== Install VMware WebMKS SDK on CloudForms appliance
Remote console for VMware vCloud cloud provider requires VMware WebMKS SDK to be installed on CloudForms appliance.
Following steps are needed to install it:

1. SSH to the CloudForms appliance console as root user.
2. Create a new directory `webmks` in the `/var/www/miq/vmdb/public/` directory:
+
----
/var/www/miq/vmdb/public/webmks
----
+
3. Download and extract the contents of link:https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/html-console/[VMware WebMKS SDK]
   into the `webmks` directory.

Directory structure similar to the one shown below should now reside in the newly created webmks directory:
```
webmks/
├── css
│   ├── extended-keypad.css
│   ├── main-ui.css
│   ├── trackpad.css
│   └── wmks-all.css
├── img

│   └── touch_sprite.png
└── wmks.min.js
```
