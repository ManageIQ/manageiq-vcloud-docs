== Remote Console Access to {vcd-provider-full}

*Remote console* is a graphical window that allows you to view desktop of a virtual machine, and to interact
with that virtual machine in a similar way to a physical machine.

{vcd-provider} supports establishing remote console against running virtual machines. Console window
is opened in browser using https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/html-console[VMware HTML5 WebMKS Console SDK].
Due to VMware licensing restrictions, Red Hat cannot ship the WebMKS SDK in {cfme}.

NOTE: {vcd} itself needn't be accessible from user's browser directly since {cfme-appliance} serves as
proxy between the two. Remote console feature should work as long as browser can access {cfme}.

=== Prerequisites
Following prerequisites need to be met in order to be able to use remote console access:

* VMware WebMKS SDK must be installed on {cfme-appliance}.
* *VMware WebMKS* option must be selected as default VMware Console Support.
* Virtual machine that we're establishing remote console against must be powered on.

==== Installing VMware WebMKS SDK on {cfme-appliance-title}
Remote console for {vcd-provider} requires VMware WebMKS SDK to be installed on {cfme-appliance}.
Following steps are needed to install it:

1. SSH to the {cfme-console} as root user.
2. Create a new directory `webmks` in the `/var/www/miq/vmdb/public/` directory.
